    "## Exercise 1: Creating class, attributes, methods with Online Shopping Cart\n",
    "Create a class called _Shopping_\n",
    "1. Each _Shopping_ must contain the following attributes:\n",
    "   - __name__ which indicates the name of the user example: Shopping(\"Rita\")\n",
    "   - __cart__ which indicates the list of goods selected..\n",
    "   - __balance__ which indicates the total cost of the goods selected. Default value is 0.0.\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "2. Each _Shopping_ must contain the following methods:\n",
    "   - __select__ which takes in 2 arguments: _name_ indicating item selected and _price_ (default value 0.0) indicating price of the good selected. It should add the price to the __balance__ attribute and the item name to the list attribute __cart__ . Finally it should return the new __cart__ attribute. \n",
    "   - __check_balance__ which returns a print statement as follows: \"Your current balance is {self.balance} Eur\"\n",
    "   - __remove_item__ which takes 2 attributes: _name_ indicating item and _price_ (default value 0.0) indicating price of the item. It should subtract the price from the __balance__ attribute and delete the item name from the list attribute __cart__ . Finally it should return the new __cart__ attribute.\n"

    "Create two classes __Dominant__ and __Recessive__ having attributes:\n",
    "1. The dominant class has following attributes: __seed_shape__ (default='round'), __pod_color__ (default='green'), __flower_color__(default='purple')\n",
    "2. The recessive class has following attributes: __seed_shape__ (default='wrinkled'), __pod_color__ (default='yellow'), __flower_color__(default='white')\n",
    "3. Create subclass __Pea__ which inherits from the above two classes, having same attributes but donot spcify them. Let Python's mro assign them to the \"dominant\" traits."

    "## Exercise 3: Inheritance, name wrangling, class methods with Online Video Calling App\n",
    "Create a class __VideoApp__\n",
    "1. The _VideoApp_ must contain the following class attributes:\n",
    "   - __participants_online__ which contains the number of active callers default to 0\n",
    "   - _action_ containing a list of 2 strings: \"speaking\", \"silent\"\n",

    "   - _company_ which indicates the company represented by the caller \n",
    "   \n",
    "4.  The _VideoApp_ must contain the following methods: \n",
    "   - __go_online__ which increases the attribute _participants_online by 1\n",
    "   - __go_offline__ which subtracts 1 from the attribute _participants_online and returns the new _participants_online\n",
    "   - _status_ which takes argument _action_ and checks if the action argument matches the string in the _action_ class attribute, otherwise throws ValueError: \"The user must either be \"speaking\" or \"silent\"\". It also returns the message: \"{self.user_name} is _action_\"\n",
